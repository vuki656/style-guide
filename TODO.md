- Use new plugin for sorting https://perfectionist.dev/ and remove rimac
- Re-enable react hooks rules that are commented out
- Cli to init configs for all tools and for eslint to pick (ex: which testing tool, strict ts or
  not, etc)
- Replace release plugin
- Storybook isn't in the default export with others since it requires storybook package (and crashes
  if not found), figure out what to do with that
