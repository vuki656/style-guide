- use new plugin for sorting
- remove rimac plugin
- cli to init configs for all tools and for eslint to pick (ex: which testing tool, strict ts or
  not, etc)
- storybook isn't in the default export with others since it requires storybook package (and crashes
  if not found), figure out what to do with that
